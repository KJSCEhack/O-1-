Artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals. Such systems can still be benchmarked if the non-goal system is framed as a system whose "goal" is to successfully accomplish its narrow classification task. General intelligence is among the field's long-term goals. Subfields have also been based on social factors (particular institutions or the work of particular researchers). A typical AI perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Approaches include statistical methods, computational intelligence, and traditional symbolic AI. "robotics" or "machine learning"), the use of particular tools ("logic" or artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical differences.
