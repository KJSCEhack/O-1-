Speaker 0 : so not very clear recording %HESITATION that Richard I apologize for that but issued clear speaker hi sing Conchita I shall see she speaks quite well but I think she sounds best %HESITATION because she has set and I'm kind of tricks that she uses it didn't tricks what you mean by that she uses lots of Phyllis and %HESITATION hesitation devices for well for example when she speaking she says like quite a lot and %HESITATION %HESITATION quite a lot and you know now these words don't have any meaning in themselves but the very useful to make yourself sound more fluent %HESITATION I'm confident so %HESITATION if you'll speaking and %HESITATION you want to know give the %HESITATION the main pression that that you could use that these things like %HESITATION and %HESITATION and and that kind of used to your exaggerating you're making that you're using is quite a lot if you use these Phyllis hesitation devices too much it can actually sound quite irritating right so they have good things to use to make you send that to but don't over do it not too much
Speaker 2 : I just took us I don't know live ten or eleven %HESITATION just to play against the wall and I was staying I as
Speaker 0 : %HESITATION I think there was some particular places we might think about way you could incorporate well you could use this this %HESITATION sound and think about the the extra center it makes it let me give you an exam will have enough number eight player if I'm giving my opinion for example I might use %HESITATION the expression I think now to give myself some time to think about my opinion I could say I thing because %HESITATION there's a very strong to sound that you make yourself some very natural you're right so so your service linking the woods in the ideas together that sounds natural listen even yourself thinking time if I was giving you some advice maybe I could say if I were you on eight %HESITATION we have this sound very very natural very confident sounding and it does sound itself %HESITATION is is is common in many parts of English isn't it it's coming in in many languages in fact not old languages but yes in English and we we use it unlocked %HESITATION so country just talking about I had to practice you know it was difficult you know and this you know it doesn't mean anything but it just makes it sound like it more confident we'll seventh and again that the sound hmmm it with the other examples of of where we use this %HESITATION sound okay the sound is %HESITATION not the the the the the is the most common sound in English %HESITATION we use it all the time if there's one one sound which %HESITATION people should listen when the speaking English it's it's it's it's %HESITATION sound for example she says and I was like playing huh so instead of saying and she says then hmmm instead of saying walls she says was and instead of saying hi to she says huh no it's not lazy speech some people might say that's not speaking properly I know not to told it's the correct way to speak if you don't use the %HESITATION sound you'll going to find your speech much slow %HESITATION it's going to be more difficult because you have to pronounce every would %HESITATION re correctly using you'll now %HESITATION moving you'll Malfa locked it's how we speak in English so it's a very weak sound which helps you be move more more fluent when you're speaking Humm %HESITATION help soften the if you think about when you learned some a gramma %HESITATION structure for example think about when you come Pat two things %HESITATION we say Towle than One west speaking very quickly we say told it then yeah I I think for example call got Callum I'm I'm well me to seventy and how tall are you %HESITATION I have no idea in that match I know I'm five foot %HESITATION five eight now okay see I think you're about one seven font evil or something always eat so so %HESITATION you ought to older than I am yeah yeah until then you okay total the total in its it's %HESITATION it's not total ban it taller than yeah look how difficult it is to say told %HESITATION then I'm I'm compared to older than and it's what people really say that's the important point so apart from this week's found this %HESITATION sound any other particular pronunciation points you %HESITATION you would like to draw our attention to yet country to loses the tea on the end of some of her words %HESITATION which again is is the correct thing to do in in certain situations %HESITATION she stays %HESITATION see what happens out the note see what happens out that which is much more difficult to say so again by losing certain sounds she makes a speech more fluent
